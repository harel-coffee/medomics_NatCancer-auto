# MEDomics - Nature Cancer Study

This repository provides the framework to reproduce the main learning experiments of the MEDomics manuscript submitted to <em>Nature Cancer</em> in April 2020. Improvements from contributors are expected over time and will be identified via specific commit checkpoints. The exact results produced by this framework may eventually slightly differ from the original ones found in our study over the different checkpoints. 

## Prerequisites
* We use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io) as our package manager.
* We require Python 3.7+

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:medomics/medomics_NatCancer.git
cd medomics_NatCancer
conda env create -f medomics_NatCancer.yml
conda activate medomics_NatCancer
```

## Using this repository

This repository is subdivided into three main high-level experiments of our study:
* Experiment1_KM: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 4 of the manuscript. 
* Experiment2_ML: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 5 of the manuscript.
* Experiment3_NLP: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 6 of the manuscript.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of each section.
