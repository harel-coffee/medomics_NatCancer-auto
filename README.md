# MEDomics - Nature Cancer Study

This repository provides the framework to reproduce the main learning experiments of the MEDomics manuscript submitted to <em>Nature Cancer</em> in April 2020. Improvements from contributors are expected over time and will be identified via specific commit checkpoints. The exact results produced by this framework may eventually slightly differ from the original ones found in our study over the different checkpoints. 


## Using this repository

This repository is subdivided into three main high-level experiments:
* Experiment1_KM: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 4 of the manuscript. 
* Experiment2_ML: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 5 of the manuscript.
* Experiment3_NLP: section used to reproduce the test experiments of current Figure 6 of the manuscript.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of each section.
