## General information

1. 'Algorithms' folder: contains 7 different algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector machine, CART, LASSO, Univariate Coxph and multivariate Penalized Coxph).
     * Parameter tuning is done using a gird seach technique for each algorithm using chosen cross-validation method.
     * Refer to the specific algorithm for details about parameter search bound.
     * For imbalanced classifications: SMOTE algorithm is automatically used to balance data in training. 
 
2. 'Dataset' folder: contains folder for training and testing datasets. 
     * Dataset with name "Training_Dataset.csv" and "Testing_Dataset.csv" must be present to execute Random Forest, Support Vector machine, CART and LASSO algorithm.
     * "Training_Dataset_COX.csv" and "Testing_Dataset_COX.csv" must be present to execute Univariate Coxph.
     * "Training_Dataset_multi_COX.csv" and "Testing_Dataset_multi_COX.csv" must be present to execute multivariate Penalized Coxph.
     * Training data should be balanced, i.e. having equal number of patients in both classes.
     * The first row in all files must refer to patient IDs and last row to the value of the class.
     * <em>Work in progress</em>: adding sample datasets to this repository.

3. 'Results' folder: contains results for each algorithm. 
     * Please see below for more info.
     * <em>Work in progress</em>: adding sample results to this repository.

4. Evaluation_Figure: reads results in the 'Results' folder and plots the ROC curves, bar charts and importance scores.
     * <em>Work in progress</em>: adding sample results to this repository.

## Algorithms

* Main scripts
     1. Main_Train_Algorithms.R => Training code
     2. Main_Test_Algorithms.R => Testing code
     3. Main_Training_Testing_Class_Probability.R  => Obtaining class and probability of training and testing dataset from final model 

* Executing code
     * Load the script and simply run in Rstudio 
     * Command line:  
          1. cd to folder .../Auto_OML/Algorithms
          2. Rscript Main_Train_Algorithms.R                    # For training
          3. Rscript Main_Test_Algorithms.R                     # For testing
          4. Rscript Main_Training_Testing_Class_Probability.R  # For class and probability


* Results
All the results for all algorithms will be written in the folder 'Results' inside the corresponding algorithm folder. For example, if you use the Random Forest algorithm, the results will be written inside Results/Random_Forest/. The following results files will be created:  
     1. Random_Forest_Training_Results.csv        # Contains development and cross-validation results
     2. Random_Forest_Testing_Results.csv         # Contains testing results
     3. Random_Forest_Train_class_probability.csv # Contains training dataset probability and class
     4. Random_Forest_Test_class_probability.csv  # Contains testing dataset probability and class

* NOTES
     1. There are various cross-validation methods avaialble: LOOCV (default), 5/10-fold, 5/10-repated 5/10 cross-validation.
     2. The grid search bounds for the number of splits and number of decision-trees (default 500) in random forests can be changed.
     3. There are various options that can be modified.

## Evaluation_Figure
For executing the code, load the script and run it in Rstudio. Command line:
1. cd to folder .../Auto_OML/Evaluation_Figure/.
2. Rscript Evaluation_Figure.R # Graph will be saved in the same folder.
3. Graph (Cross-validation, Testing): ROC and AUC.
